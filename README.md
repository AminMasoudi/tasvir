### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/B1cc3ZGQD2g
### Description: 
    'Picture' is a web app that anyone can upload a picture to show it to everyone!!
    i wrote the flask app in 'app.py' and some functions in 'healpers.py'
    when you upload a picture it will be save at '/static/img/' and the form info such as **Photographer name**, **Discription** and the picture's name will be save at 'Final.db' on table 'upload'
    when an admin log in he/she can see the uploaded pictures and he/she can decide to delete it or give it the permision to be shown by clicking on 'Y' or 'N' 
    when Y clicked the info of picture will be moved to table 'load' 
    index shows the 'load' table's Pictures
